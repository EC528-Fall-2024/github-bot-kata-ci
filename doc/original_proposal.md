* **Project name:** Github Bot for Kata Containers CI
* **Project proposer:** Aurelien Bombo <abombo@microsoft.com>
* **Will the project be open source?** yes
* **Full list of mentors for the project:** Aurelien Bombo <abombo@microsoft.com>
* **Preferred past experience: - what technical skills will be needed for this project?**
  * Scripting (Bash, Python, or similar)
  * CI/CD: Automated testing via GitHub Actions pipelines (similar to Jenkins)
  * Git
* **Project background:**
  * Kata Containers is an open source community working to build a secure
    container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel and
    perform like containers, but provide stronger workload isolation using
    hardware virtualization technology as a second layer of defense.
  * [https://katacontainers.io/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://katacontainers.io/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726708547372965&usg=AOvVaw3QolIPpRLBWNf-khheorJO)
* **Project description:**
  * As Kata Containers support many different systems, architectures,
    hypervisors and other underlying technologies, CI (continous
    integration) along with a stable and automated test environment are
    paramount to the success of the project. As such, the community is
    continuously investigating ways to strengthen our testing pipelines and
    make our processes more efficient.
  * To this end, this project would implement a GitHub bot for the Kata
    Containers CI to automate various tasks. This is a high-visibility
    project as your contributions would impact every single contribution
    made to Kata and you would be able to leverage and be supported by the
    entire community. There are many potential use cases for this bot, and
    as such you would get a lot of freedom in terms of what tasks to
    implement into the bot.
  * We expect students to:
    * Evaluate and potentially leverage existing tools, such as Prow (used by the Kubernetes project and others): [https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/overview/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/overview/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726708547373958&usg=AOvVaw2WVaAxq9j3CSruM91qIUe4)
    * Work with the community to investigate and propose tasks to integrate into the bot.
    * Implement said tasks, ranging from executing chat-ops commands from GitHub
      comments, to generating automated test reports, to evaluating code
      quality, and much more.
* **What team members will learn:**
  * Automation (GitHub Actions) and scripting (Bash, Python)
  * Open source best practices - code quality, code review, version control,
    project management, feature tracking, issue resolution, etc.
  * Collaborating within a global open source community and among leading tech companies
  * Container runtimes and virtualization
